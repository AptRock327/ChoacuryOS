Stylized as Choacury/OS or simply Choacury, this project is a custom-built OS written in C and uses the GRUB bootloader. 
Choacury is currently in a **Pre-Zeta** stage, meaning some stuff isn't complete yet...

# System Requirements
TBA

# To compile Choacury
If you want to help with the project, make your own Choacury distro, or compile Choacury from the source code, here's what you will need:
1. A text editing program like Notepad, or Visual Studio Code.
2. NASM installed.
3. QEMU installed. (uses the `x86_64` version. If you don't use that version of QEMU, replace `qemu-system-x86_64` in the compiler files with your version of QEMU)
4. Both GRUB and XORRISO are installed.
5. A computer running any Linux distro (recommended but we do have a Windows Compiler for Windows devices along as you have WSL enabled).
6. A standard knowledge of Assembly and C.
