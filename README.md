# ChoacuryOS
Stylized as Choacury/OS or just simply Choacury, this project is a custom-built OS written in C/C++ and Assembly. Choacury is currently in a **Pre-Zeta** stage, meaning some stuff isn't complete yet...

If you want to help out or make your own distro to Choacury, don't worry, it is completely open-source!

# System Requirements
TBA

# For helpers
If you want to help with the project, here's what you will need:
1. A text editing program like Notepad, or Visual Studio Code.
2. NASM installed.
3. QEMU installed. (uses the `x86_64` version. If you don't use that version of QEMU, just replace `qemu-system-x86_64` in the compiler files with your version of QEMU)
4. A computer running any Linux distro (recommended but there is a Windows Compiler for Windows devices).
5. A standard knowledge of Assembly and C.
