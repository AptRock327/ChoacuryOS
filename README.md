Choacury, (pronounced as coch-curry or /kʰɔx-ˈkʌr.i/), is project is a custom-built OS written in C/C++ and Assembly. Choacury is currently in a **Pre-Zeta** stage, meaning some stuff isn't complete yet...

If you want to help or make your own version of Choacury, don't worry, you are free to modify it to your liking. You are also free to help contribute to the project! (see TODO.MD for what is needed doing).

# System Requirements
Choacury currently doesn't work with live (real) hardware, currently, it only works with virtual machines.

For VirtualBox Users, here are the recommended VM requirements:
- Operating System: Other/Unknown
- Base Memory: 64 MB.
- Video Memory: 9 MB.
- Hard Disk: 2.00 GB.

# For helpers
If you want to help with the project, here's what you will need:
1. A text editing program like Notepad, or Visual Studio Code.
2. NASM, GCC, and QEMU installed. (the compiler uses the `x86_64` version of QEMU. If you don't use that version of QEMU, replace `qemu-system-x86_64` in the compiler shell script with your version of QEMU)
5. A computer running any Linux distro (recommended but there is a Windows Compiler for Windows devices along as you have WSL enabled).
6. A standard knowledge of Assembly and C.
