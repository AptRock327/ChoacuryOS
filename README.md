# ChoacuryOS
Stylized as Choacury/OS or simply Choacury, this project is a custom-built OS written in C/C++ and Assembly. Choacury is currently in a **Pre-Zeta** stage, meaning some stuff isn't complete yet...

If you want to help or make your own version of Choacury, don't worry, you are free to modify it to your liking. You are also free to help contribute to the project! (see TODO.MD for what is needed doing).

# System Requirements
TBA

# For helpers
If you want to help with the project, here's what you will need:
1. A text editing program like Notepad, or Visual Studio Code.
2. NASM installed.
3. QEMU installed. (uses the `x86_64` version. If you don't use that version of QEMU, replace `qemu-system-x86_64` in the compiler files with your version of QEMU)
4. A computer running any Linux distro (recommended but there is a Windows Compiler for Windows devices along as you have WSL enabled).
5. A standard knowledge of Assembly and C.
