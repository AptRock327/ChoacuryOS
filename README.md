# ChoacuryOS
Stylized as Choacury/OS or just simply Choacury, this project is a custom-built OS written in C/C++ and Assembly. Choacury is currently in a **Pre-Zeta** stage, meaning some stuff isn't complete yet...

If you want to help out or make your own distro to Choacury, don't worry, it is completely open-source!
