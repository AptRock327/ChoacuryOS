# ChoacuryOS
Stylized as Choacury/OS or simply Choacury, this project is a custom-built OS written in C/C++ and Assembly. Choacury is currently in a **Pre-Zeta** stage, meaning some stuff isn't complete yet...

If you want to help or make your own distro to Choacury, don't worry, it is completely open-source!

# System Requirements
TBA
# To Compile
To compile Choacury, here what you need:

1. NASM installed.
2. QEMU installed. (uses the `x86_64` version. If you don't use that version of QEMU, replace `qemu-system-x86_64` in the compiler files with your version of QEMU)
3. A computer running any Linux distro (recommended, but there is a Windows Compiler for Windows devices along as you have WSL enabled).
4. A standard knowledge of Assembly and C.
